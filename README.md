Arcedemy app
<h4>Intro:</h4>'Arcedemy' is a learning app for the students of Cambridge and the Edexcel curriculum. The motto of the app is to learn by playing quizzes and fun competitive rooms with friends. Students can enjoy live exam rooms, a library and resources, and watch their regular progress by using the app.
<h4>Technical architecture:</h4> 

The whole system architecture is very simple. Admins can upload the resources through a `web-module` and using an API we will serve the resources to the main `app-module`.

## Web module
<h4>Brainstorming and design:</h4>

- `Web-module` is basically to handle the admin functionalities like resource uploading, user management, and so on.
- Client-side includes a landing page where some raw data will be shown about the services and users can directly send the mails and DM to customer care.
  
<h4>Web-module dashboard navigation design and prototype</h4> 

- We have used `figma` to design the  `web module navigation planning` and `dashboard prototyping`
- Admin dashboard prototype: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vZOPQH5mdcIv58d7WFGIGZ/Arcedemy-app?page-id=872%3A634&node-id=872-637&viewport=944%2C-607%2C1.16&t=2FyICIuUS6bIeoUY-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=872%3A637">prototype</a>

## App module

<h4>Brainstorming and design:</h4>

- `App-module` handles the client or user side mainly. 
- Users can learn, take tests, explore notes and videos and so on. No admin functionalities will be done here.
  
<h4>App-moddule design and prototype</h4> 

- We have used `figma` to design the  `app-module navigation planning` and `prototyping`
- App module prototype: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vZOPQH5mdcIv58d7WFGIGZ/Arcedemy-app?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=396-75&viewport=823%2C318%2C0.06&t=KlfjLZVTvxGaElB8-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=396%3A75">prototype</a>
