# Arcedemy app description
<h4>Intro:</h4>'Arcedemy' is a learning app for Cambridge students and the Edexcel curriculum. The motto of the app is to learn by playing quizzes and fun competitive rooms with friends. Students can enjoy live exam rooms, a library and resources, and watch their regular progress by using the app.
<h4>Technical architecture:</h4> The whole system architecture is very simple. Admins can upload the resources through a <b><i>web-module</i></b> and using an API we will serve the resources to the main <b><i>app-module</i></b>
